# Deep Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow 2.0

This repository contains source code accompaying the blog post [Deep Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow 2.0](http://inoryy.com/post/tensorflow2-deep-reinforcement-learning/).

In the blog post I showcase the upcoming TensorFlow 2.0 features through the lense of deep reinforcement learning by implementing an advantage actor-critic agent, solving classic CartPole-v0 environment. While the goal is to showcase TensorFlow 2.0, I also provide a brief overview of the DRL methods.

You can view the code either as a [notebook](actor-critic-agent-with-tensorflow2.ipynb), a self-contained [script](a2c.py), or execute it online on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12QvW7VZSzoaF-Org-u-N6aiTdBN5ohNA).
